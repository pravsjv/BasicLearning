Chapter1:
Three desirable properties for any algorithm:
	- correct
	- efficient
	- easy to implement

Correct algorithms usually comes with a proof of correctness, which is an explanation of why an algorithm must take every instance of the problem to the desired result.

Take-Home Lesson: There is a fundamental difference between algorithms, which always produce a correct result, and heruistics, which may usually do a good job but without providing any guarantee.

Take-Home Lesson2: Reasonable looking algorithms can be easily correct. Algorithm correctness is a property that must be carefully demonstrated.
